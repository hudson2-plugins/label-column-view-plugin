The label-column-view-plugin is a hudson plugin to create a view and add a new column to the view.
This column shows for each job for the latest build the current label.
This plugin dows not search the real label. It only shows a number in combination with strings like you configure it in the view
configure section.
(Because most of the times, people label their builds as external job oder external ant task or something else)

default behaviour
i.e. if jobName is DAILY and lastBuild is number 13 then lastLabel = DAILY-13 

special behaviour
i.e. if prefix is "01.02.39-" and lastBuild is number 13 then lastLabel = 01.02.39-13

When you configure the view, you have to add the label column to the view.
In the textfield you have to list (; separated) the Jobs, for which a label exist.
If you want to use the special behaviour you have to list the jobs in the textfield as follows:
NIGHTLY<01.02.44-> to have the label result 01.02.44-13
